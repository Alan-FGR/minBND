<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>Documentation for the usage of C# bindings generated by the minBND tool.</p>
<p>If you're reading this you probably followed a link in the documentation of a C#/.NET library that uses minBND to generate code.
Since the code will be similar in all of the libraries generated by minBND, we maintain the common documentation here.</p>
<h2 id="minbnd-generated-bindings-overview">minBND Generated Bindings Overview</h2>
<p>minBND generates 100% GC-free bindings that are very minimal and readable. There is basic type handling by default and conversions between different typing profiles. The bindings should work reasonably well out of the box for any project, although they might not the the most efficient since minBND does not make heroic assumptions and counts on the user to configure it properly. The most important configuration is declaring the blittable types. If minBND cannot safely generate code, user interverion might be necessary. Types can always be blacklisted and handled manually by the user. minBND does not attempt to be the ultimate solution, it simply aims to automate what can be reasonably automated, what when properly done coud represent 100% of an API.</p>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p>This document uses specific terminology. While there's no consensus whether some of those terms are accurate or can be used interchangeably, we pay attention to stick to their meanins as follows:</p>
<h4 id="blittable">&quot;Blittable&quot;</h4>
<p>This simply means the memory layout/representation of the object is exactly the same on both sides, so they can simply be copied around. This does not imply in any other property of an object. Due to lack of ABI standardization, inheritance is a hard problem to solve and minBND is not guaranteed to generate code for blittables that is compatible with your ABI. Blitting objects in which data members are added throughout the inheritance is discouraged.</p>
<h4 id="pod">&quot;POD&quot;</h4>
<p>Plain Old Data as specified and parsed by Clang. This basically means data-only objects. Default values (C<ins>11 field def) do <strong>not</strong> mean the object isn't a POD, and due to lack of standardization there's room for discussion about differences between compilers. Normally this is referred to as a C</ins>03 POD, although C++11 features affect Clang parser.</p>
<h4 id="returnable">&quot;Returnable&quot;</h4>
<p>The fact an object is blittable does <strong>not</strong> mean its value can be returned from native into managed code. The fact the object is a POD in theory should mean it's safe to return, but this is a complicated subject and minBND 5 onwards does not rely on the &quot;returnability&quot; of complex blittable types (non-primitives) in order to avoid potential problems.</p>
<h4 id="wrapper">&quot;Wrapper&quot;</h4>
<p>This term does not necessarily mean there's interoperation and generally a &quot;wrapper&quot; code is written in the same language of the wrapped object. In a general contest, the term &quot;Wrapper&quot; is the C code that wraps the C/C++ objects and functions.</p>
<h4 id="bindings">&quot;Bindings&quot;</h4>
<p>Binding is the managed code that interoperates with the native code through Pinvoke. These are exclusively managed code and might not include the Pinvoke code when there's a distiction (e.g. the Pinvokes can be generated in files separated from the Bindings).</p>
<h4 id="pinvoke">&quot;Pinvoke&quot;</h4>
<p>Also written P/Invoke (Platform Invoke), in this document written exclusively as &quot;Pinvoke&quot;, is the actual language interoperation code. These are <code>extern</code> function declarations attributed with a <code>DllImport</code>. In a general context this could simply mean interoperation.</p>
<h3 id="generated-managed-types">Generated Managed Types</h3>
<h4 id="primitives">Primitives</h4>
<p>Primitives are value types that are available on both native and managed side, types like <code>float</code> and <code>int</code> are primitives. They are represented the same way on both sides. Please note that in the context of bindings, these don't necessarily map into the primitives of your language, a notable example is the <code>boolean</code> type for example which might need special handling/marshaling. Numeric types are normally consistent as long as their size match.</p>
<h4 id="pointer-wrappers">Pointer Wrappers</h4>
<p>As the name suggests, these are managed objects that hold pointers to native memory. By default object that aren't blittable nor primitives are handled by pointer wrappers. On the managed side they are value types that work as typed pointers. The</p>
<h5 id="public-fields">Public Fields</h5>
<p>Managed getters and setters are automatically generated for all public fields in objects handled as pointer wrappers. These getters are bound as properties so they are acessed just like normal fields although under the hood they are Pinvoke calls to native code.</p>
<h5 id="newing-and-freeing">Newing and Freeing</h5>
<p>Pointer Wrappers can be newed with the static <code>New()</code> method and freed with the static or <code>Free(TPtr ptrWrapper)</code> method, or alternative with the non-static <code>Free()</code> method of the object.</p>
<p>In most APIs you are required and responsible for freeing what you allocate after the object isn't necessary. So as a rule of thumb you'll want one <code>Free()</code> for each <code>New()</code> in your code.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> check <a href="#value-to-pointer-conversion">Value to Pointer Conversion</a> for possibly relevant information.</p>
<h5 id="value-to-pointer-conversion">Value to Pointer Conversion</h5>
<p>When a given object is handled as a Pointer Wrapper in minBND, but objects of that type are returned by value in managed code, chances are the object should be handled as a Blittable. When that's not possible, instead of simply not binding that code, minBND will bind them with some special glue code that allocates memory and returns a pointer to those objects. That operation naturally requires you to manually free the returned pointers afterwards, and to make that clear all methods that allocate memory have a <code>_New</code> suffix, so you should manually free their returning objects after use.</p>
<h5 id="why-not-use-the-dispose-pattern-idisposable">Why not use the dispose pattern (IDisposable)?</h5>
<p>Implementing IDisposable would imply the object should be manually disposed, what depending on the API will almost never be the case.
In any sane API you should only be responsible for freeing what you allocate, so you shouldn't be freeing objects from queries for example, and in many cases those objects might be the ones you've created (think spatial queries for example, like getting objects in some area).</p>
