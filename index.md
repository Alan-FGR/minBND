**Common Bindings Documentation**

## What is this?

Documentation for the usage of C# bindings generated by the minBND tool.

If you're reading this you probably followed a link in the documentation of a C#/.NET library that uses minBND to generate code.
Since the code will be similar in all of the libraries generated by minBND, we maintain the common documentation here.

### Why not use the dispose pattern (IDisposable)?

Implementing IDisposable would imply the object should be manually disposed, what depending on the API will almost never be the case.
In any sane API you should only be responsible for freeing what you allocate, so you shouldn't be freeing objects from queries for example,
and in many cases those objects might be the ones you've created (think spatial queries for example, like getting objects in some area).
