## Using the public minBND documentation in your project

We recommend that you use the public minBND docs in your bindings documentation. The latest documentation will always be available in markdown (extra flavor) at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alan-FGR/minBND/master/index.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alan-FGR/minBND/master/index.md). Feel free to parse that file directly, or point your users either to the GitHub link [here](https://github.com/Alan-FGR/minBND/blob/master/index.md), or [this link](https://alan-fgr.github.io/minBND/) which renders the markdown in the client browser.
